# Installation

Welcome to installation!

## Install Sipa CLI tools

Sipa provides a simple but powerful set of command line (CLI) tools to make developing web apps comfortable and fun.

### npm vs Yarn

You can install Sipa by using npm or Yarn. npm is the default node package manager. But many people prefer using yarn as it is usually working much faster and gives a better user experience. If you are not sure what to use, then use npm.

:::info
If you want to find out more about Yarn, you can find more information about it and how to install it, in its official [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs).
:::

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="win" label="npm">
```
```bash
npm install -g sipa
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash" label="yarn">
```
```bash
yarn global add sipa
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Check Sipa installation

After installing Sipa with the command of the previous section, you can check if its CLI is available on the command line:

```bash
sipa -v
```

You should get a response like this:
```bash
sipa 0.9.1 @ 2023-12-15T14:21:36.170Z
```

:::caution
If you get an error instead, that the command does not exist and used Yarn to install Sipa, ensure that the Yarn bin directory is added to the `PATH` variable as [described in the Yarn docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/global#adding-the-install-location-to-your-path).
:::

Otherwise you can continue with the [Sipa CLI](guides-basics/sipa-cli).
