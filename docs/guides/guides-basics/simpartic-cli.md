# Simpartic CLI

Simpartic provides a powerful command line interface (CLI) to support the developer on his daily work.

You can either use the long name `simpartic` or its cool short cut `sipa` on the command line.

With the CLI you can
* Create new projects
* Start and run a live webserver with on the fly SCSS processing
* Generate new pages, js libraries or layouts
* Automatically include or exclude new files or libraries
* Create minified distribution builds

To list all available commands, just run `sipa` on the command line.
