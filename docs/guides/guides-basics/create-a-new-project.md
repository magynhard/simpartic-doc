# Create a new project
On the commandline run
```bash
sipa new
```
or just `sipa n` to create a new project as subfolder of the current directory.

A interactive setup assists you and generates the project depending on your input.

After that, you can run your new project, when you run `sipa server` or just `sipa s` in its project root directory.

The development server will then automatically boot up and open your project in the web browser, containing a default layout and page.
