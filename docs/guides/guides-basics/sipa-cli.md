# Sipa CLI

Sipa provides a powerful command line interface (CLI) to support the developer on his daily work.

Usually you just use the `sipa` command. For backward compatibility you can still use the long name `simpartic`.

With the CLI you can
* Create new projects
* Start and run a live webserver with on the fly SCSS processing
* Generate new pages, js libraries or layouts
* Automatically include or exclude new files or libraries
* Create minified distribution builds

To list all available commands, just run `sipa` on the command line.
