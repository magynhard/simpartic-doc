# Create a new page

Sipa projects are structured into logical pieces called "pages".

A page consists of 
* a HTML template file
* a JS page file
* a SCSS style sheet file

## Page life cycle

Before a page is loaded, a layout will be loaded first, and then the page will be put into the layout and rendered.

```md title="page life cycle"
Trigger Page Load -> Applied Layout is loaded (if not already present) -> Page is loaded
```

## Load another Page
Another pages can be loaded with `SipaPage` class. When using `onsenui` and mobile development, use the `SipaOnsenPage` class the same way!

```js
// desktop
SipaPage.load('imprint', options);
// onsenui
SipaOnsenPage.load('imprint', options);
```

## Create a new page

To create a new page, we use the Sipa CLI with its generators at the root directory of our Sipa project:

```bash
# start generator
sipa g
# choose page
p
# enter page name for e.g. settings page
settings
# or even sub settings pages
settings/user
```

### Structure

A page consists always of 3 (4) files:
```
├── settings.js
├── settings.html
├── settings.scss
└── settings.css
```

Never modify the `css` file manually, as it is automatically compiled and overwritten by the `scss` source file!

In the `scss` file you can even use only CSS, as SCSS is a superset of CSS.

If you do not know SCSS, a variant of SASS, yet, you should start know learning it!
